# Plan for workshop

* Stick all of this directory tree in a public repo, called, eg. "stats-dce-workshop", in advance of the meeting
* Use RMarkdown and knitr to build interactive slides and demos

## Part 0: Getting started

Stuff to do in advance of the meeting, like install R and R-Studio and do a quick tutorial

* https://www.r-project.org/
* https://www.rstudio.com/
* http://portal.stats.ox.ac.uk/userdata/ruth/APTS2013/APTS.html

## Part 1: Graphical models

* Probability and tree diagrams
* Decision trees
* Conditional probability tables, joints, and factorisations
* DAG probability models
* Undirected graphs, moral graphs and junction trees
* Conditioning, Bayes theorem and propagation
* Influence diagrams
* Graphical models in R

## Part 2: Bayesian hierarchical models

* Bayesian inference (and cts Bayes theorem)
* Priors and regularisation
* Random effects and borrowing strength
* GPs?
* Random effects over regression models
* Fitting distributions
* Prediction and some simple UQ?
* Joint versus marginal uncertainty and issues for multivariate UQ
* Synthetic example on rail line?
* BHMs in R - rjags and/or rstan??

## Part 3: Computer models

* Complex codes
* GPs
* Validation and calibration
* UQ
* LHDs
* 2d GPs for modelling heterogeneity
* GMRFs?
* Very simple running toy example to illustrate ideas? Limit equilibrium model?
* Computer models in R
